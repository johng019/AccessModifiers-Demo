# AccessModifiers-Demo
This Demo shows where methods with some common access modifiers can be seen and used throughout an application.
It contains a Main Method that calls available methods from an external Assembly class. 
This can be accomplished either directly (to the base class method) or indirectly through other classes 
depending on the Access Modifier. The Access modifiers used in this Demo are :
Public, Private, Protected, Internal, Protected Internal, and Private Protected.
